# Testing Approaches

There are two ways of testing. If you are using a framework in your application for example, you may attach Stove
to your application, so that you can debug and look with a magnifying glass to your code base. This is especially
helpful
when one wants to see how code works when the physical dependencies are present. Because, unit and integration tests
stay short
for the deeper insights when it comes to the behaviour of the system on production.

Choose your testing strategy:

- [I will attach my application to Stove E2e testing framework _(recommended)_](./attaching)
- [I will keep my application as Black Box](./black-box)
